# 🎮 Roll Ball AR/VR Unity Project

This project is a 3D AR/VR game built in Unity where the player controls a ball that rolls across a platform-based environment. The goal is to collect objects, navigate obstacles, and reach the endpoint without falling off.

The game combines classic "Roll-a-ball" mechanics with immersive AR/VR support, providing an interactive and engaging experience.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Physics-based ball movement using Unity’s Rigidbody system
- Player-controlled movement via joystick or tilt input
- AR/VR integration for immersive gameplay (supports VR headset or AR-compatible mobile)
- Collectibles and score tracking
- Reset and game-over conditions

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Unity Engine** (version: specify your version here)
- **C#** for scripting
- **AR Foundation / XR Toolkit** (specify which you used)
- Basic 3D modeling and UI elements

## 📁 Project Folder Structure
- `Assets/`: Contains all game assets including models, materials, scripts, prefabs, and UI
- `Scenes/`: Unity scenes used in the game (e.g., MainMenu, GameScene)
- `Scripts/`: All C# scripts responsible for movement, score tracking, input, and game logic

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Open the project in Unity Hub or Unity Editor.
2. Open the main scene (usually inside the `Scenes/` folder).
3. Press Play or build for your target platform (Android/iOS/PC/VR).

## 📌 Notes
